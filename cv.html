                                                    <li>Team Spark is The University of Iceland's Formula Student Team. These teams design and build, from scratch, single seat race cars. Formula Student publishes extensive rules that the car must comply with. I designed and manufactured about 90% of the aerodynamics kit as well as the entire cooling system for the current car named Katla. As of 2022-2023 I am the technical manager of the team. Through the team I have worked extensively with prepreg carbon fiber composites through Össur, our sponsor, to make various parts in the car. I have also done some work we wet layup composites and am begining to experiment with infusions.</li>

                                                    <li>Along side my father I have finished the construction of a Kitfox III kit aircraft. The kit is delivered as a welded 4130 steel airframe, some fiberglass composite parts, some specialized metal parts and a whole bunch of raw material. The builders then follow instructions to build parts and assemble the plane. In total, between myself and my dad, we've put in around 1500 work hours. The plane, named TF-RED flew in late summer 2022 but has since been plagued by intermittent engine issues and so it does not fly regularly as of this writing. </li>
