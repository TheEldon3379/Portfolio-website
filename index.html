											<h2>Project 1</h2>
											<h3>Creation of the website</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											To start I downloaded and installed Brackets and Git Bash as per assignment page on Canvas. I also made a Github account to host the website. I had never used HTML but upon downloading and opening a website format it didn't look too bad. I used the format Halcyonic from <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5 UP</a>, mostly because the secondary pages had almost only text. Later I would strip out most of the features on the index page and put a block of text instead to keep this simple. The first problem I ran into was when following the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGuNTpc293hpIpAVSJ3-SgNolCTa1BfJE">Youtube instructions</a> to upload the site to Github using Git bash. I'm not sure what caused the problem but I was unable to upload data to the my github repository with the following error message.

											After some unsuccessful googling I checked if someone from the year before had run into the same issue and sure enought Sæmundur had the same issue. <a href="https://saemi10.github.io/TolvustuddFramleidsla/V1.html">Sæmundur's page</a> had a command that fixed the problem. After running those two command the files uploaded successfully to the repository.

                                            <body>
                                            
                                                <img src="./images/git_error.jpg" alt= "pic">
                                            
                                            </body>
                                        
									
										<p>
											From here it took me an annoyingly long time to find the right settings on Git hub to get the website live since the settings GUI has changed since the aforementioned tutorial videos were made.

                                        <p>
											Since then I changed the font to Serif since it is significantly more readable than the original font. I made all of the other pages into the single column with no side bars, mostly because I don't have anything to put on the side bars.
